            <p>I honestly don't know which is worse; your balding possum, or the smell of blue cheese with funny little white lumps (wonder if those are toenails?), and quite possible some larva. Anyways, in the words of Donald Trump - "You'll be great. Just not as great as me. You're like, Level 1. I'm definitely Level 100. Also, don't forget to buy my personal online trading cards... everyone knows how good they are, especially me. Take my word for it, you won't regret spending money on me. And all the money I get is going towards food funding for the homeless! <i>Secretary, make sure all the homeless get 10%, but leave at least 99% percent for me.</i>"</p>
